 I'm not a fan of the word, but I'm a fan of the word. I'm a fan of the word. Wow. What an audience. But if I'm being honest, I don't care what you think of my talk. I don't.

I'm doing mine in under a minute. I'm at 44 seconds right now. That means we've got time for one final joke. Why are balloons so expensive? Inflation.
